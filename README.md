## **StrinLand**

A game where you build and do what you want, the game is still in development, it will have multiplayer and a lot of interesting things, I hope you like it, there will be a project website soon, developed by the Füls team.

  

> You can play on Windows and MacOS.

  

Also, this game **can be changed**, **downloaded**, **make mods** for your clients and whatever you want, **this project is not about money**, **only about chaos.**

  

>  **FUN FACT**:*when **developing** the **acceleration of the character**, there was an error from which the character gained **speed of about 60 bl per second*****

  

## **0.0.3 BETA! Let's start checking**

The game will be supplemented and updated constantly, a lot of ideas, if you also have ideas, you can send me an email which is indicated in my profile, or contact me through social networks

## **Updates**

**Already done**

 - acceleration character [LEFT SHIFT]

 - big inventory in out script now

 - debug menu with [fps, [x, y], speed]

 - change hot keys
 
 - change blocks textures

	 1. Open inventory [LEFT CTRL + E]
	 2. Open debug [LEFT CTRL + Q]
	 3. Open pause menu [ESCAPE]
 - now instead of teustur blocks there will be textures of items in the inventory and hand

  

## **DOWNLOAD and checking**

>To play the BETA version of the game you need to download [python-v3.1](https://www.python.org/) .*(there is no project build yet, because this is a beta-test)*

  

To start the project, you need to download its master and write **2 commands** in the terminal on your PC.
**with installed pygame.**

`python3 assets/app.py`

  

> if you get an error:
