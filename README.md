## **StrinLand**
A game where you build and do what you want, the game is still in development, it will have multiplayer and a lot of interesting things, I hope you like it, there will be a project website soon, developed by the Füls team.

> You can play on Windows and MacOS.

Also, this game **can be changed**, **downloaded**, **make mods** for your clients and whatever you want, **this project is not about money**, **only about chaos.**

> **FUN FACT**: when the building was being developed, the player was building over **10,000 blocks per second** *(it was calculated by the algorithm)* which caused the game to *crash* and *not start again*

## **0.0.1 BETA! Let's start checking**
The first version of the game, it still has little content, but already has inventory, blocks, building, pause and more.

>To play the BETA version of the game you need to download [python-v3.1](https://www.python.org/) .*(there is no project build yet, because this is a beta-test)*

To start the project, you need to download its master and write 2 commands in the terminal on your PC.

    cd [master path]
    python3 assets/app.py

> if you get an error:
> `command not found: python3`
>     
> you need to enter python instead of python3
> `python assets/app.py`
